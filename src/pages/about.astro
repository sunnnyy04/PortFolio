As a Second-year BTech student, I am passionate about technology and development. My journey in the tech world has equipped me with a strong foundation in full-stack development, specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Proficient in C++, I enjoy solving complex problems and creating efficient, scalable solutions.
